Welcome, This is going to be my space for some thoughts on some things. Mainly Software Development, but possibly other things too.

Today is July 20th, I'm at my go-to coffee shop in the Central West End, STL. Its hot. I went hiking yesterday, and now I've decided hiking is fun.
I'm gonna plug away at learning some more elixir/erlang, in hopes of throwing those skills at some cool embedded projects.

I'm listening to some [dope jams][dope-jams]


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
